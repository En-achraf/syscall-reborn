## ðŸ“š About

As a student at 1337 and a passionate system-level programmer, I created this repo to:

- Deepen my knowledge of Linux internals  
- Practice working with file descriptors and system calls  
- Reinforce my C programming and debugging skills  

Each function is carefully rebuilt in C to closely reflect its original Linux behavior, with clear structure and purpose.
